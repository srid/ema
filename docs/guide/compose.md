# Composing Ema apps

Smaller Ema apps can be composed together to create a larger app. 

See `Ex04_Multi.hs` in the Ema source tree for an example of this based on a top-level route ADT. The `Ex05_MultiRoute.hs` example is similar but uses a heterogenous list (`NS` from sop-core) instead of defining a new route ADT. The former has the main advantage of being able to use inner apps' models in defining the behaviour of other routes.

## Builtin sub-apps

Ema provides a few "sub apps" that are useful in developing static sites.

### `StaticRoute`

`Ema.Route.Lib.Extra.StaticRoute` provides a `StaticRoute` site that can monitor a directory and allow referring to the files in it. The [[model]] for this sub-route keeps track of last-added time, which gets appended to the URL when running in [[live-server]], which in turn has the effect of "refreshing" the target content (eg: image) when the underlying files change.

An example of its use can be seen here: https://github.com/EmaApps/ema-template

### `PandocRoute`

`Ema.Route.Lib.Extra.PandocRoute` provides a `PandocRoute` site that can monitor a directory of LML files (Markdown, org-mode, etc.) and return (in `siteOutput` of [[site]]) the parsed Pandoc AST along with a function that renders it to HTML.
