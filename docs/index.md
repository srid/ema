[Ema](https://github.com/srid/ema) is a next-gen library for building [jamstack-style](https://jamstack.org/) static sites in [**Haskell**](https://srid.ca/haskell). Ema sites are *change-aware*; in addition to good ol' static site generation, Ema provides a [[live-server|live server]] supporting **fast hot-reload** in the browser, on code *or* data change. 

{.text-gray-600} 
The ultimate purpose of ema is to facilitate creating with ease your own [neuron](https://neuron.zettel.page/)[^emanote], or just about any app that creates a _browser view of arbitrarily changing data_ (on disk, database, or whatever). In Ema apps, data is _edited_ via traditional mechanisms (e.g., text editor), and its view is _rendered_ as a delightful web page, thus economically providing a read-only view of your data on desktop & mobile. A classic static site is just one type of such [*kind*]{title="See what we did there?"} of apps.

[^emanote]: This ultimate purpose is already realized in regards to neuron; see [Emanote](https://emanote.srid.ca/), which is built on top of Ema.
